Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the DevOps Engineer (Terraform Specialist) position. With over 8 years of experience spanning DevOps engineering, cloud operations, and full-stack/software development, I have built a strong foundation in designing automated, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructures. My background aligns closely with the responsibilities and technical requirements outlined for this role, particularly in Infrastructure as Code, Azure, and CI/CD automation.

In my most recent role as a Senior DevOps Engineer, I designed and maintained cloud environments using Terraform, creating reusable modules, implementing workspaces for multi-environment management, and ensuring proper state handling. I also collaborated closely with development teams to enable consistent, reliable deployments across distributed environments. My experience includes implementing cloud-native architectures, improving delivery pipelines, and automating complex operational processes to enhance system reliability and reduce manual intervention.

I have hands-on experience deploying and managing Azure-based infrastructures, including networking, IAM, load balancers, monitoring, and security controls. I have also built and optimized CI/CD pipelines using tools such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps. My scripting experience with Bash and Python, along with expertise in Docker and Kubernetes, allows me to troubleshoot, automate, and improve systems effectively.

Having worked as a full-stack software developer earlier in my career, I bring strong problem-solving abilities, familiarity with application lifecycles, and the ability to collaborate deeply with development teams — qualities that enhance the DevOps collaboration model. I also maintain a professional English level of B2–C1, allowing effective communication within international and cross-functional teams.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a team that values automation, reliability, and continuous improvement. I am confident that my experience with Terraform, Azure, CI/CD, microservices, and distributed systems would allow me to add value quickly in this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background aligns with your needs.

Sincerely,
Thomas
