1. “Can you walk me through your DevOps experience?”

Answer:
“Sure. I’ve spent over 8 years building CI/CD pipelines, managing cloud infrastructure, and supporting production systems.
At Vieaura, I built Bitbucket pipelines, managed Kubernetes clusters on GCP/AWS/Azure, and automated deployments for OPTRIX’s real-time platform.
Before that at RevBits, I built backend security features in Python and Java and supported secure software delivery.
Overall, I focus on automation, reliability, and scaling cloud systems.”

2. “What’s your experience with AWS?”

Answer:
“My recent projects were mostly on GCP, but I do have hands-on AWS experience with EC2, S3, IAM, and VPC from earlier work and side environments.
And because Kubernetes, CI/CD, and cloud networking concepts carry over, picking up AWS services like EKS, CloudWatch, and CodeDeploy would be fast for me.”

(This is honest + still strong.)

3. “Have you built CI/CD pipelines?”

Answer:
“Yes. At Vieaura I built and maintained CI/CD pipelines in Bitbucket for OPTRIX deployments.
I’ve automated build steps, testing, containerization, and rollout processes for Kubernetes.
I’m also familiar with Git-based workflows and integrating automation into release cycles.”

4. “Tell me about your Kubernetes experience.”

Answer:
“I’ve managed production Kubernetes clusters on GCP, built deployment configurations, automated rollouts, and monitored workloads.
For OPTRIX, I supported high-availability clusters that served real-time spatial awareness features.”

5. “What programming languages are you strongest in?”

Answer:
“Python and Java.
I used both heavily at RevBits for backend development, security features, and data processing.”

6. “Have you handled production troubleshooting or incident response?”

Answer:
“Yes. I’ve diagnosed deployment issues, performance bottlenecks, Kubernetes workload failures, and backend service bugs.
I work quickly, communicate clearly, and prioritize restoring stability before deep-diving root causes.”

7. “Do you have experience with compliance frameworks like SOC2, HIPAA, or FedRAMP?”

Answer:
“I’ve contributed to secure software development at RevBits, including addressing vulnerabilities and strengthening access control.
I haven’t done formal FedRAMP or SOC2 evidence automation yet, but I’m familiar with the concepts and comfortable learning the compliance workflows.”

8. “What’s your time zone? Can you work PST hours?”

Answer:
“Yes, I’m in Texas, and PST hours work perfectly for me.”

9. “Why are you interested in this role?”

Answer:
“I enjoy building reliable cloud infrastructure at scale. Your emphasis on automation, high availability, and continuous improvement aligns strongly with my experience.
I also like joining teams where I can solve complex problems and help strengthen DevOps processes.”

10. “What are your salary expectations?”

Answer (safe version):
“For now I’m flexible. I’d like to learn more about the role expectations and your compensation range, and I’m sure we can find a number that works for both sides.”

✅ BONUS: They May Ask About Git & Collaboration

Q: “How do you use Git in your workflow?”
A:
“I use Git for branching strategies, code reviews, and pipeline triggers. I’m comfortable with feature branches, PR reviews, and automated deployments from Git events.”

✅ BONUS: They May Ask About Teamwork

Q: “How do you communicate with teams?”
A:
“I keep communication clear and proactive, especially during releases or troubleshooting. I’m used to Jira workflows, standups, and collaborating across dev, QA, and product.”
